# Computer-Vision And Image Processing

![](assests/neural_networking.jpg)<br>
The terms "computer vision" and "image processing" are used almost interchangeably in many contexts. They both involve doing some computations on images. But are they really the same thing? Let's talk about what they are, how they are different, and how they are linked to each other.


Image processing focuses on, well, processing images. What this means is that the input and the output are both images. An image processing algorithm can transform images in many ways: smoothing, sharpening, changing the brightness and contrast, highlighting the edges, and so on.

Computer vision, on the other hand, focuses on making sense of what a machine sees. A computer vision system inputs an image and outputs task-specific knowledge, such as object labels and coordinates.

Computer vision and image processing work together in many cases. Many computer vision systems rely on image processing algorithms. For example, computer vision systems rarely use raw imaging data that comes directly from a sensor. Instead, they use images that are processed by an image signal processor.
